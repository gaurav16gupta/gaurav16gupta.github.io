I am a 4th year PhD student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Rice University. I work with [Prof. Anshumali Shrivastava](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~as143/) in the [RUSHLAB](https://rushlab.blogs.rice.edu/). My primary research area is Extreme Scale Deep Learning using Randomized Hashing methods.

I previously interned as an *Applied Scientist* at **Amazon Search**, Palo Alto from *May 2018 - Aug 2019*. I worked on a myriad of problems like query to product prediction, super-fast reformulation for zero result queries, query-category prediction and fast approximate nearest neighbor search. My paper **Extreme Classification in Log Memory using Count-Min Sketch: A Case Study of Amazon Search with 50M Products** in conjunction with Amazon got published at **NeurIPS 2019**. 

I received my Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) in Electrical Engineering (2011-2015) from [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in).

Here is my [`resume`](https://tharun24.github.io/Resume.pdf).
