I am a 5th year PhD student, working with [Prof. Anshumali Shrivastava](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~as143/) at [RUSH](http://rushlab.blogs.rice.edu/about/team/) Lab of [Rice University](https://eceweb.rice.edu/), Electrical and Computer Engineering department. I am working on information retrieval, large scale Machine Learning, and randomized algorithms. Hashing and sketching based methods are my favorites. 

During 2014 to July 2018, I was a part of Tata Consultancy Services Innovation Labs, Delhi, India, where I worked with [Dr. Gautam Shroff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gautam-shroff-066901/) and [Dr. Lovekesh Vig](https://sites.google.com/site/lovekeshhome/). I worked in the area of computer vision, deep learning and augmented reality. You can find my [CV](https://gaurav16gupta.github.io/CV_GauravGupta.pdf) and [Publications](https://gaurav16gupta.github.io/publications/).

I have Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) in Electrical Engineering (2010-2014) from [Indian Institute of Technology,Hyderabad, India](http://www.iith.ac.in). In final year, I worked with [Dr. Sumohana Channappayya](https://www.iith.ac.in/~sumohana/) on Multiple Target Tracking.  

Take a look at my recent and old [Projects](https://gaurav16gupta.github.io/projects). 

Apart from work I often travel and enjoy Photography ([500px](https://500px.com/gaurav16gupta), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/gaurav16gupta/)).
