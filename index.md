I am currently an Applied Scientist at Amazon Search, where I work on solving challenging problems in information retrieval and search technologies.

From 2018-2023, I was PhD student, working with [Prof. Anshumali Shrivastava](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~as143/) at [RUSH](http://rushlab.blogs.rice.edu/about/team/) Lab of [Rice University](https://eceweb.rice.edu/), Electrical and Computer Engineering department. My research focused on large-scale information retrieval, leveraging randomized algorithms and deep learning.
From 2014 to 2018, I was a part of the Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Innovation Labs in Delhi, India. There, I worked with [Dr. Gautam Shroff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gautam-shroff-066901/) and [Dr. Lovekesh Vig](https://sites.google.com/site/lovekeshhome/) on projects involving computer vision and augmented reality. 

I earned my Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) in Electrical Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology,Hyderabad, India](http://www.iith.ac.in).
